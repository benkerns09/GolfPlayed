<h1>Tinder for Golf</h1>

<h3>About</h3>
<p>Tinder for golf is an internal tool for GolfPlayed. The tool allows for sorting of images that will ultimately be implemented in a mobile golf app. There are two types of images to be sorted: golf course logos and golf course pictures. This tool presents the user one image at a time and allows the user to swipe left for logo and right for picture. The tool then moves the image to the correct folder in the database.</p>
